# Library-Scheduling
Two types of people can enter into a library- students and teachers. After entering the library, the visitor searches for the required books and gets them. In order to get them issued, he goes to the single CPU which is there to process the issuing of books. Two types of queues are there at the counter-one for students and one for teachers. A student goes and stands at the tail of the queue for students and similarly the teacher goes and stands at the tail of the queue for teachers (FIFO). If a student is being serviced and a teacher arrives at the counter, he would be the next person to get service (PRIORITY-non preemptive). If two teachers arrive at the same time, they will stand in their queue to get service (FIFO).
